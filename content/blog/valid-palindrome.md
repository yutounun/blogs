## Problem Description

A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.

Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, or false otherwise.

### Examples:

- **Example 1:**

  ```plaintext
  Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
  Output: true
  Explanation: "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.
  ```

- **Example 2:**

  ```plaintext
  Input: s = "race a car"
  Output: false
  Explanation: "raceacar" is not a palindrome.
  ```

- **Example 3:**

  ```plaintext
  Input: s = " "
  Output: true
  Explanation: s is an empty string "" after removing non-alphanumeric characters.
  Since an empty string reads the same forward and backward, it is a palindrome.
  ```

### Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 2 \* 105
s consists only of printable ASCII characters.

## Answer

### Intuition

First solution that comes up with me was to check all elements of a given string and reverse it to check if the reversed one and original one is same.

### Approach

1. Iterate a given string
2. Check each element if it's alphabet or digit or something else.
3. If it's alphabet or digit, merge it to a "clean_word"
4. At last, check if the reversed one and original one is same.

### Complexity

- Time complexity: O(n)

- Space complexity: O(n)

### Code

```
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:
        cleaned_word = ''

        for char in s:
            if char.isalpha() or char.isdigit():
                cleaned_word += char.lower()

        return cleaned_word == cleaned_word[::-1]
```

### Another solution with two pointers

```
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:
        l = 0
        r = len(s) - 1

        while l < r:

            while l < r and s[l].isalnum() == False:
                l += 1
            while r > l and s[r].isalnum() == False:
                r -= 1
            if s[l].lower() != s[r].lower():
                return False
            else:
                l += 1
                r -= 1
        return True
```
